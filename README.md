# Rust URL Shortener

The purpose of this project is to test my skills with the Rust language, yet delivering something useful.

## TODO:
- [x] The backend application, with:
    - [x] a `POST` route *enshorten* an URL
    - [x] a `GET` route to retrieve and redirect into the original URL
- [ ] The frontend counterpart, [yew](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew) looks good enough to do this job
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Benchmarks?
